# Hello! I'm Curtis.

## I am a professional programmer who has spent the last few months learning Full-Stack Web Development with JavaScript.

### I recently earned my Full Stack JavaScript Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. I love the design aspect of front-end development and the logic aspect of back-end development! I've stored my code from the Nanodegree on here, and I plan to develop my own projects soon.
